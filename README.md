# Zsolt Bedohazi

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Student (Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary) and Senior Software Engineer passionate about using machine learning, deep learning, to solve challenging real world problems especially in the biomedical domain with strong scientific background and experience in research and industry.

In my PhD I focus on computer vision and deep learning for biomedical imaging. I currently work on developing weakly-supervised and self-supervised (SSL) deep learning models and methodologies for digital pathology and medicine.


## 🏆 Competition Results

1. #### [Nightingale Detecting Active Tuberculosis Bacilli - 2024](https://app.nightingalescience.org/contests/m3rl61qq21wo)

    International contest about detection of TB bacilli on microscopy images. Collaborated with with [Andras Biricz](https://github.com/abiricz) we developed an innovative solution based on transfer learning with novel vision encoders and self-supervised training.

    🏆 Won the contest.

2. #### [Nightingale High Risk Breast Cancer Prediction Contest - Phase 2](https://app.nightingalescience.org/contests/vd8g98zv9w0p)

    International challenge focused on utilizing machine learning and deep learning to predict cancer stage solely from WSIs generated by breast biopsies.
    Teamed up with [Andras Biricz](https://github.com/abiricz) we developed an powerful methodology based on a state-of-the-art hierarchical vision transformers architecture.

    🏆 Won the contest.
