# Zsolt Bedohazi

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Student (Eötvös Loránd University) and Senior Software Engineer (MSCI Inc.) passionate about using machine learning, deep learning, to solve challenging real world problems especially in the biomedical domain with strong scientific background and experience in research and industry.

In my PhD I focus on computer vision and deep learning for biomedical imaging. I currently work on developing and applying supervised and unsupervised models and methods for pathological whole slide images.


## 🏆 Competition Results

1. ### [Nightingale High Risk Breast Cancer Prediction Contest - Phase 2](https://app.nightingalescience.org/contests/vd8g98zv9w0p)

    International challenge focused on utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict cancer stage solely from gigapixel whole slide images generated by breast biopsies.
    Teamed up with [Andras Biricz](https://github.com/abiricz) we developed an powerful methodology based on a state-of-the-art hierarchical vision transformers architecture.

    🏆 Won the contest.


2. ### [Nightingale High Risk Breast Cancer Prediction Contest - Phase 1](https://app.nightingalescience.org/contests/3jmp2y128nxd)

    International challenge focused on utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict cancer stage solely from gigapixel whole slide images generated by breast biopsies.
    Teamed up with [Andras Biricz](https://github.com/abiricz) and [Oz Kilim](https://github.com/ozkilim) we created an efficient algorithm based on deep multi-instance learning and transfer learning.

    🏆 Won the contest.

3. ### [Covid CXR - "Artificial Intelligence for Covid-19 prognosis: aiming at accuracy and explainability" Hackathon](https://web.archive.org/web/20220924165541/https://ai4covid-hackathon.it/)

    The goal of the Hackaton was to predict Covid-19 severity from early chest X-ray imagines and clinical metadata with effective machine learning and deep learning models with focus on explainability. Participated with a team of four: [Alex Olar](https://github.com/qbeer), [Andras Biricz](https://github.com/abiricz), [Bendeguz Sulyok](https://github.com/bsulyok). 

    🥈 2nd place overall.

    🏆 1st prize for the most accurate model.
